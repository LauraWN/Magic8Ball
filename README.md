# Magic8Ball
a "magic 8 ball" type application that will display the magic 8 ball's answer to a user's question.

User Stories:
1. “As a user, I want to be able to log into the site so I can only see my questions.”

2. “As a user, I want to be able to see the answers to my questions.”

3. “As a user, I want to be able to delete my questions in case I no longer have an interest in that question.”

4. “As a user, I want to be able to ask the same question and get a different answer.”

5. “As a user, I want to be able to see other users’ questions and answers.”

6. “As a user I want to be able share my questions and answers with others.”

7. “As a user, I want to be able to comment on other users’ questions and answers.”

With this application, a user will log in and be able to ask a question. The Magic 8 Ball will provide an answer to the question. 

Once I figure out how to embed a link, a photo of my wireframe will be here.
